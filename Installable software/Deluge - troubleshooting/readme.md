**Important note:** If you are on the server `eros` and your deluge does not load properly it is most likely being blocked by an ad blocker. You will need to white list the URL:

~~~
eros.feralhosting.com

Deluge is our favoured client because for the time being, it is the most stable.

If you do have problems it can be restarted by following these instructions: [Restarting - rtorrent - Deluge - Transmission - MySQL](https://www.feralhosting.com/faq/view?question=158)

The thin client allows you to control it remotely from your desktop as if you were running it locally: [Deluge Daemon - Remote control with the local Thin client](https://www.feralhosting.com/faq/view?question=76)

The thin client is a necessity if you run a lot of torrents in the client where the web ui just won't work. If you run into this you will see the error "connection to webserver has been lost!" a lot. The thin client also allows you to create torrents and use the plugins that come with Deluge.
