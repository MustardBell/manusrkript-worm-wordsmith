This process started on request from the user via the Software Installation page.is automated. After it has started it can take anywhere from a few seconds to 20 minutes to set up and complete. Please be patient while this process 

**Important note:** Occasionally the installer does not complete, meaning the "You have requested..." dialogue never gets updated. In this case you can:

**1:** Re install it using the Install software page. This will just restart the process and fixes the issue 99% of the time. This is a common recommendation for troubleshooting installer issues.

If that does not work then:

**2:** Open a  support ticket and use a relevant ticket title. Do not use a title like "HELP!!!" as is not particularly useful to staff in accessing your problems or needs at a glance.

If this still does not work, open a [support ticket](https://www.feralhosting.com/manager/tickets/new) and things will be sorted out manually.

**Important Note:** If you have just received your slot, please allow some extra time for things to work, even after the process has show to be completed.
