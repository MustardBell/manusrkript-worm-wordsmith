**Requires Android: 4.0 and up**

This works on stock, non rooted Android 4.0 and up devices to connect to OpenVPN on your slot.

### How to Connect to Feral OpenVPN on your Android 4.0 and up device

Install OpenVPN from the software installation page. Once this is done we need to copy our keys to our android device.

On your feral slot your keys folder is located here.

```
~/private/vpn
```

You will need to copy this folder to your android device storage and make one small change to the directory structure.

**OpenVPN Connect requires all files be in the same directory regardless.**

We must move the `client.ovpn` into the keys folder or move the contents of the `keys` directory into the same folder with the `client.ovpn`

This is what how the files must be on your android device:
