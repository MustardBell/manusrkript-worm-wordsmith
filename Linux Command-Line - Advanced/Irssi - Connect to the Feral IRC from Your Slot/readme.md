Here is the basic set-up to get connected to the Feral IRC channel using Irssi from your Feral slot. It will get you connected using SSL to the Feral IRC channel using irssi.

Doe these commands in [SSH](https://www.feralhosting.com/faq/view?question=12):

**1:** Create a required folder and get a custom theme

~~~
mkdir -p ~/.irssi/scripts/autorun
wget -qO ~/.irssi/xchat.theme http://irssi.org/themefiles/xchat.theme
~~~

**2:** Get a nick colour script:

~~~
wget -qO ~/.irssi/scripts/autorun/xchatnickcolor.pl http://dave.waxman.org/irssi/xchatnickcolor.pl
~~~

**3:** Create a screen and open irssi in it using this command:

~~~
screen -S irssi irssi
~~~

Once it has loaded copy or type these commands to configure your username. Where `username` is your Feral username (it can be something else):

~~~
/set NICK username
/set user_name username
/set real_name username
/HILIGHT username
~~~

**4:** Optionally, make some more configuration changes:

~~~
/set autolog ON
/set recode_autodetect_utf8 ON
/set recode_fallback utf-8
/set recode_out_default_charset utf-8
/set term_charset utf-8
/set theme xchat
~~~

**5:** Configure your server and channel settings:

**Important note:** Remove `-auto` to stop it automatically connecting on start-up:

~~~
/network ADD What-Network
/server ADD -ssl -auto -network What-Network irc.what-network.net 6697
/channel ADD -auto #feral What-Network
~~~

**Important Note** If you have already registered your Nick on IRC you can do this now instead of in step 7:

~~~
/network ADD -autosendcmd "/msg nickserv IDENTIFY YourPassGoesHere;wait 2000" What-Network
/server ADD -ssl -auto -network What-Network irc.what-network.net 6697
/channel ADD -auto #feral What-Network
~~~

You can add more commands if required. They are separated by a `;` like this:

For example, this version works for me to ghost my username on connect to make sure I always connect as the same user.

~~~
/network ADD -autosendcmd "/msg NickServ GHOST username YourPassGoesHere;wait 2000;/nick username;wait 2000;/msg NickServ IDENTIFY YourPassGoesHere;wait 2000" What-Network
~~~

**6:** Save your configuration changes

~~~
/save
~~~

**7:** Now while you are still inside this screen you can use this command to connect

~~~
/connect What-Network
~~~

If you Nick is not already registered you can do so now like this:

~~~
/msg NickServ REGISTER YourPassGoesHere YouEmail@GoesHere
~~~

Where `YourPassGoesHere` is the password you wish to use and `YouEmail@GoesHere` is an email address you use to register with.

Then update your configuration file to automatically do this when you connect next time using this command:

~~~
/network ADD -autosendcmd "/msg nickserv IDENTIFY YourPassGoesHere;wait 2000" What-Network
~~~

Then save the updated configuration:

~~~
/save
~~~

**8:** Changing windows

You can change windows using these commands:

~~~
/window 1
/window 2
/window 3
/window 4
~~~

Or use the `ESC` key and a number, for example: Press and hold `ESC` then press `3`. If you are already on this window it will just print the number.

Detach from the screen using this keyboard sequence:

The press and hold `CTRL` and `a` then press `d` to detach from the screen. This leaves it running in the background.

Use this command to re attach to the screen:

~~~
screen -r irssi
~~~

And that is basically it. You are automatically connecting to the What-Network, Feral channel with a username
