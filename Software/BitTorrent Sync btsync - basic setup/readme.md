Here are some basic set-up steps for btsync.

Info: Automatically sync files via secure, distributed technology. [btsync homepage](http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync.html)

You will need to execute these commands in [SSH](https://www.feralhosting.com/faq/view?question=12)

~~~
mkdir -p ~/btsync
wget -qO ~/btsync/btsync.tar.gz http://download.getsyncapp.com/endpoint/btsync/os/linux-x64/track/stable
tar xf ~/btsync/btsync.tar.gz -C ~/btsync && rm -f ~/btsync/btsync.tar.gz
~~~

We are going to use a custom conf file with some tweaks. Please use this file and not the dummy conf generated by the binary. The custom conf has some basic things already configured.

Use this command to get it. It will be downloaded to the right location.

~~~
wget -qO ~/btsync/sync.conf http://git.io/tnT60g
~~~

Now run this command to set a few variables we need:

~~~
sed -i 's|MYHOME|'"$HOME"'|g' ~/btsync/sync.conf
sed -i 's|####|'$(shuf -i 6000-49000 -n 1)'|g' ~/btsync/sync.conf
~~~

You must now configure your `~/btsync/sync.conf` Web interface credentials and port before you run the program.

You can edit this file over ftp. Please see this FAQ for how to do this properly [Text editing - Over FTP or SFTP](https://www.feralhosting.com/faq/view?question=219)

Or in SSH:

~~~
nano -w ~/btsync/sync.conf
~~~

This is the part you must edit.

~~~
"login" : "USERNAME",
"password" : "PASSWORD"
~~~

Something like this:

**Important note:** The `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` you create here is unique, just for the btsync Web Gui. It is not related to any Feral provided passwords.

~~~
"login" : "superman",
"password" : "drowssap"
~~~

Once you have done this edit, execute this command. It will send itself to the background.

~~~
~/btsync/./btsync --config ~/btsync/sync.conf
~~~

To access the Web Gui you must use a browser and visit the URL, where `username` is your Feral username and `server` is the name of your Feral server that hosts the slot btsync is installed on:

**Important note:** `https` is not supported by bysync. You must only use `http`

Use this command  to see the generated WebUi port via SSH:

~~~
sed -rn 's|\s*"listen" : "0.0.0.0:(.*)",|\1|p' ~/btsync/sync.conf
~~~

Then modify the example Url below with yoru server information and WebUi port listed by the previous command:

~~~
server.feralhosting.com:PORT
~~~

For example:

~~~
chronos.feralhosting.com:34567
~~~

or

~~~
username.server.feralhosting.com:PORT
~~~

For example:

~~~
superman.chronos.feralhosting.com:34567
~~~

Either will work.

Kill btsync
---

To Kill the processes use this command to find running instances:

~~~
ps x | grep btsync | grep -v grep
~~~

Kill all btsync processes this way:

~~~
killall -9 -u $(whoami) btsync
~~~
