**Important Note:** There is a conflict between the new version of btsync released `1.4.75` and the previously configured conf file used in this FAQ. You will need to do these three things:

**1:** Download the conf file again and follow the steps below this notice to configure it. You do not need to set a username or password this time. You will be prompted to create this when you visits the WebUi.

**2:** restart btsync using this command in SSH:

~~~
killall -u $(whoami) btsync && ~/btsync/./btsync --config ~/btsync/sync.conf
~~~

**3:** Clear your browser history and cache completely and then reload the WebUi

**End of Notice**

~~~

btsync manual installation
---

Here are some basic set-up steps for btsync.

Info: Automatically sync files via secure, distributed technology. [btsync homepage](http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync.html)

You will need to execute these commands in [SSH](https://www.feralhosting.com/faq/view?question=12)

~~~
mkdir -p ~/btsync
wget -qO ~/btsync/btsync.tar.gz http://download.getsyncapp.com/endpoint/btsync/os/linux-x64/track/stable
tar xf ~/btsync/btsync.tar.gz -C ~/btsync && cd && rm -f btsync/btsync.tar.gz
~~~

We are going to use a custom conf file with some tweaks. Please use this file and not the dummy conf generated by the binary. The custom conf has some basic things already configured.

Use this command to get it. It will be downloaded to the right location.

~~~
wget -qO ~/btsync/sync.conf http://git.io/tnT60g
~~~

Configure the conf file:
---

Now run this command to set a few variables we need:

~~~
sed -i 's|MYHOME|'"$HOME"'|g' ~/btsync/sync.conf
sed -i 's|####|'$(shuf -i 6000-49000 -n 1)'|g' ~/btsync/sync.conf
~~~

Start Btsync:
---

Now start btsync using this command:

~~~
~/btsync/./btsync --config ~/btsync/sync.conf
~~~

The result will look like this:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feralhosting/feralfilehosting/master/Feral%20Wiki/Software/BitTorrent%20Sync%20btsync%20-%20basic%20setup/btsyncstarted.png)

It is now running in the background ready for us to use.

Accessing the WebUi
---

To access the Web Gui you must use a browser and visit the URL, where `username` is your Feral username and `server` is the name of your Feral server that hosts the slot btsync is installed on:

**Important note:** to use https you can use the URL format `username.server.feralhosting.com` without editing the conf. You may have to press `F5` a few times for the Gui to load after accepting the invalid cert.

Use this command  to see the generated WebUi port via SSH:

~~~
sed -rn 's|.*"listen" : "0.0.0.0:(.*)".*|\1|p' ~/btsync/sync.conf
~~~

Then modify the example URL below with your server information and WebUi port listed by the previous command:

~~~
server.feralhosting.com:PORT
~~~

For example:

~~~
chronos.feralhosting.com:34567
~~~

or

~~~
username.server.feralhosting.com:PORT
~~~

For example:

~~~
superman.chronos.feralhosting.com:34567
~~~

Either will work.

Using the WebUi
---

Once you are at the WebUI you will be prompted to create a user account. This is only for accessing and using the WebUI.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feralhosting/feralfilehosting/master/Feral%20Wiki/Software/BitTorrent%20Sync%20btsync%20-%20basic%20setup/webuipass.png)

Once you have done this step you will be prompted to log in:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feralhosting/feralfilehosting/master/Feral%20Wiki/Software/BitTorrent%20Sync%20btsync%20-%20basic%20setup/webuiauth.png)

ONce logged in your are ready to use btsync.

Kill btsync
---

To Kill the processes use this command to find running instances:

~~~
ps x | grep btsync | grep -v grep
~~~

Kill all btsync processes this way:

~~~
killall -u $(whoami) btsync
~~~
