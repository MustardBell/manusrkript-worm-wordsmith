In SSH do these commands. Use this faq if you do not know how to SSH into your slot: [SSH basics - Putty](https://www.feralhosting.com/faq/view?question=12)

Execute these commands:

~~~
mkdir -p ~/spideroak
wget -qO ~/spideroak.deb 'https://spideroak.com/getbuild?platform=ubuntu&arch=x86_64'
dpkg-deb -x ~/spideroak.deb ~/spideroak
cp -rf ~/spideroak/usr/bin/. ~/spideroak
rm -rf ~/spideroak/etc ~/spideroak/usr ~/spideroak.deb
~~~

These commands below will do required start-up script edits for you. There are 4 commands in total:

~~~
sed -i "3iSPIDEROAK_ROOT=$(ls -d $HOME/spideroak)\n" ~/spideroak/SpiderOak
sed -i 's|LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt|LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$SPIDEROAK_ROOT/opt|g' ~/spideroak/SpiderOak
sed -i 's|QT_PLUGIN_PATH="/opt|QT_PLUGIN_PATH="$SPIDEROAK_ROOT/opt|g' ~/spideroak/SpiderOak
sed -i 's|exec "/opt|exec "$SPIDEROAK_ROOT/opt|g' ~/spideroak/SpiderOak
~~~

### Optionally you can do the start-up script edits manually:###

~~~
ls -d $HOME/spideroak
~~~

You will see a result like this:

~~~
/media/DiskID/home/username/spideroak
~~~

Edit the `~/spideroak/SpiderOak` startup script with a text editor. It will look like this:

~~~
#!/bin/sh

LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/SpiderOak/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
QT_PLUGIN_PATH="/opt/SpiderOak/lib/plugins/" ; export QT_PLUGIN_PATH
SpiderOak_EXEC_SCRIPT=$(cd `dirname $0` ; pwd)/SpiderOak
export SpiderOak_EXEC_SCRIPT
exec "/opt/SpiderOak/lib/SpiderOak" "$@"
~~~

We must edit it to be like this:

~~~
#!/bin/sh

SPIDEROAK_ROOT=/media/DiskID/home/username/spideroak

LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$SPIDEROAK_ROOT/opt/SpiderOak/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
QT_PLUGIN_PATH="$SPIDEROAK_ROOT/opt/SpiderOak/lib/plugins/" ; export QT_PLUGIN_PATH
SpiderOak_EXEC_SCRIPT=$(cd `dirname $0` ; pwd)/SpiderOak
export SpiderOak_EXEC_SCRIPT
exec "$SPIDEROAK_ROOT/opt/SpiderOak/lib/SpiderOak" "$@"
~~~

**1:** Create the new line using your result from the `ls -d $HOME/spideroak` command: `SPIDEROAK_ROOT=/media/DiskID/home/username/spideroak`
**2:** Edit the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH="...`
**3:** Edit the `QT_PLUGIN_PATH="...`
**4:** Edit the `exec "...`

Then save the file, uploading and overwriting if necessary:

###SpiderOak First run.###

You need to have already created an account on the website. If you have not already done so, please do this now here: [SpiderOak signup](https://spideroak.com/signup/)

You also need to have set-up the application on your main device before setting it up on a Feral Slot. If you try to login before doing this you will get an error like this:

![](https://raw.github.com/feralhosting/feralfilehosting/master/Feral%20Wiki/Software/SpiderOak/setuperror.png)

Once you have done that then execute this command to configure SpiderOak:

~~~
~/spideroak/SpiderOak --setup=-
~~~

![](https://raw.github.com/feralhosting/feralfilehosting/master/Feral%20Wiki/Software/SpiderOak/setup1.png)
![](https://raw.github.com/feralhosting/feralfilehosting/master/Feral%20Wiki/Software/SpiderOak/setup2.png)

When you install SpiderOak for the first time onto your machine you will create a "device". This will be linked to your main account. In this example i have already configured other devices elsewhere.

Leave this option blank when following this FAQ to create a new device, which we will call [b]FeralSpider[/b] in this example.

After you have named your new device it will take some time to synchronise.

When you see this it is done.

###Run SpiderOak in a screen:###

Type this command

~~~
screen -S SpiderOak
~~~

Once inside the screen type this:

~~~
~/spideroak/SpiderOak --headless
~~~

You will get no result as shown in the below image. No error is a good thing. If you get an error re check the step in this FAQ for configuring the start up script.

![](https://raw.github.com/feralhosting/feralfilehosting/master/Feral%20Wiki/Software/SpiderOak/screen.png)

Press this keyboard sequence to detach from the screen

~~~
ctrl a d
~~~

SpiderOak is now running on your slot.

By default in v5 of SpiderOak it will be syncing to a newly created HIVE folder in your home/root directory. You can find this folder at:

~~~
~/SpiderOak Hive
~~~

Anything you put in here will sync to your other devices Hive directory.

###Mini FAQ:###

Q: Where are the configuration files stored?

A: When you run the set-up a new, hidden directory is created at: `~/.SpiderOak`
