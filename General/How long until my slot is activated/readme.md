The [pricing page](https://www.feralhosting.com/pricing) gives an accurate total of the number of accounts that can be set up instantly, providing there are an adequate number or free slots available.

Here is an example of the pricing page where all available slots have been exhausted:

If there are no slots available in a product type, it will display: 

~~~
0* available
~~~

In this case you are put into a queue and you will get your slot when more become available.

Set up times are quoted as instant, but this is completely dependent on funds actually being transferred to us, not the completion of the payment process, for example, in Google Wallet. The system is automated so as soon as we actually receive the funds the process completes and the slot is created. 

If you are **NOT** a UK resident you may have to allow for international payments with your credit card provider in case it gets flagged as a potentially fraudulent transaction. Also, if this is your first payment to Feral your credit provider may have checks in place to protect you against irregular transactions. These are **outside of Feral's control** and we must wait until the transaction clears and payment is received before the slot can be created. You can phone your bank or credit card provider to find out more.

You will receive an e-mail containing your username and password after registering an account here.

You may want to white list Feral in case of an aggressive spam filter.

Add this to your email spam filter white list to ensure you get all emails from Feral.

**You will be sent a separate email to notify you of your slot being created and becoming accessible.**

In the mean time we suggest you take a look at the [FAQs](https://www.feralhosting.com/faq/) to familiarise yourself with the possibilities that await.
