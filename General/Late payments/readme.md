Feral staff are friendly and more importantly, reasonable. While Feral cannot always accept late payments, we especially cannot help you if you do not warn us of a potential problem. Feral would like to help and accommodate users, within reason, where we can. Any reasons given will be kept private and confidential.

In the past we have let people run over their time by a few days because they have been with us a while and are friendly, open and upfront with the issue.

If you see a potential payment, personal or other issue it is good to open a ticket and start a dialogue with the Staff. Please don't leave it until the last minute.

**1:** On suspension, slots have a **72 hour grace period** to pay. 

**2:** During these 3 days, the slot will be inaccessible but the data will be kept intact.
 
**3:** If you plan on renewing but have run into a problem, please open a ticket as soon as possible
