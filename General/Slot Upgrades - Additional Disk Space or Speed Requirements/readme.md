**Important note:** This procedure applies to moving or downgrading slots as well.

An upgraded slot is a larger one. For example, doubling a Neon slot is known as a Xenon as it offers more than twice the bandwidth and disk space.

You do not need to register a separate account for an upgrade unless you wish to change your feral username. 

In this case you will need to register a new username and account and purchase the slot as that new user. 

To upgrade or move your slot please:

**1:** Purchase the slot from our website.

**2:** Wait until you receive the slot.

**3:** Then open a ticket requesting a data transfer (optional)

**4:** Request a refund on your current slot (optional).
