Lets say you've downloaded 10% of a file and you've removed it from the queue and now you want to continue the download. Here's how you do it.

First you'll need that 10% file.

After that, go to Tools > Global Options > Transfer - Smart Overwrite.

It will say " Matching file or folder name handling " at the top (under the blue box). In the drop-down menu box called " For matching files: " choose Resume.

If it's a single file you need to continue, you're done.

If you want to continue a complete folder, choose " Use Rules " in the drop down-menu called " For matching folders: ". After that click on the button below the drop-down menus called " Configure Rules ".

There are 4 drop-down menus here, choose " no matter " in the first two, then in the third, choose " any transfer ", in the fourth choose " resume ", then click on " ADD >> ". You can then add more options if you want.

After that localize your files on the server and you local HDD. After that you can download it as usual and it should start at 10%.
